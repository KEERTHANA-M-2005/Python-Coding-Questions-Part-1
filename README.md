# 🐍 Python Coding Challenge – Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a series of **Python coding challenges** designed to strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills using only **loops, conditionals, and basic I/O, some user defined functions** — without advanced data structures or unnecessary built-in functions.

---

## 📘 Problem Set Details
- **Difficulty:** Easy → Moderate  
- **Topics Covered:** Pattern printing, number operations, string manipulation, basic algorithms  
- **Constraints:**  
  - No advanced data structures like arrays/lists  
  - Minimal built-in functions (only input/output)  
  - Solutions in pure Python

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each `.py` file corresponds to the question number from the problem set.

Q1.py
Q2.py
...
Q54.py


---

## 🚀 How to Run
Run any solution file with Python:
```bash
python Q1.py

#📌 Skills Demonstrated
